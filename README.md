# Prerequisites #

SLEIPNIR is written in Java, therefore the latest version of JDK is required.
Dependencies are resolved using Apache Maven, which is available at: <https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi>
Also, SLEIPNIR uses Apache Spark to distribute load on multiple cores.  Apache Spark can be downloaded at: <https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html>

# Download and install SLEIPNIR #

The simulator is available from github (<https://github.com/vindem/sleipnir>)
To download the latest version, you need to clone the repository running
`git clone https://github.com/vindem/sleipnir`
To install the simulator, you need to run
`mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip`
Which generates the jar archive needed by Apache Spark. In alternative, you can also use the available build.sh script

`./build.sh`

This command will generate the jar sleipnir.jar in the subfolder target/.

# Running simulation with SLEIPNIR #

## “HelloWorld” example ##

In the HelloWorld example, we simulate offloading of a workflow composed of 5 sequential FACEBOOK DAGs, executed by 1000 mobile devices. Computational infrastructure is composed of 6 cloud nodes. We simulate mobility over the area of HERNALS, divided in hexagonal cells of 2 km radius with an edge node in each cell. For offloading, HEFT list-based algorithm is used. The “HelloWorld” example is described in the source file OffloadingHelloWorld.java.

## Running HelloWorld example ##

To run SLEIPNIR, just run

`spark-submit target/sleipnir.jar`

## Simulation Setup ##

Simulation can be configured either by using command lines arguments or the configuration file simulation.json. The arguments that can be used are the following:

* -h, -? Prints usage information
* -mobile=n Instantiates n mobile devices
* -cloud=n Instantiates n cloud nodes
* -wlRuns=n Each workflows has n applications
* -cloudonly=true/false If true, simulation uses only Cloud nodes
* -area=name Urban area where the offloading is performed (possible choices: HERNALS, LEOPOLDSTADT, SIMMERING)
* -eta=n Sets the eta parameter, which is necessary to set offloading cost (the higher the eta, the lower the cost).
* -outfile=string Saves output in file filename
* -iter=n Executes simulation for n iterations
* -navigatorMapSize=# Lambda parameter for size of navigator MAP (in kb)
* -antivirusFileSize=# Lambda parameter for size of antivirus file (in kb)
* -facerecImageSize=# Lambda parameter for size of image file (in kb) for Facerec app
* -chessMi=# Lambda parameter for computational size of Chess app
* -navigatorDistr=# Probability of NAVIGATOR app in workflow (must be between 0 and 1).
* -antivirusDistr=# Probability of ANTIVIRUS app in workflow (must be between 0 and 1).
* -facerecDistr=# Probability of FACEREC app in workflow (must be between 0 and 1).
* -chessDistr=# Probability of CHESS app in workflow (must be between 0 and 1).
* -facebookDistr=# Probability of FACEBOOK app in workflow (must be between 0 and 1).
* -mobility=true/false If true, SLEIPNIR simulates mobility of users using sumo trace files. Example files for the areas of HERNALS, LEOPOLDSTADT and SIMMERING are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/flox79qk2h24oqi/sleipnir-mobility-traces.zip?dl=0)

## Notes ##

* Mobile apps and their DAGs are defined in `src/../ec/model/software/mobileapps`
